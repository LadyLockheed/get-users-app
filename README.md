# get-users-app
A small app that get users on buttonclick.

In this project I have used Next.JS and App router. This is a new framework for me that I have not tried before. But I've been wanting to learn about Next.JS for a long time and saw this as a good opportunity.

I had no direct plan of what I wanted to do beyond the criteria. This led to general confusion which made the coding take even longer. Normally I have an idea and can work based on it with both design, flow and functionality as well as file structure, but this time there was a bit of a hiccups which was not ultimate for efficiency (or for my poor commits).

However, I think it has been a lot of fun working with this app, once I figured out what I wanted to do.

I have used layout and page even though they may not have been absolutely necessary. This is to try out how they work on a very basic level.

What is missing is way more typing, as well as tests. This is something I had to opt out of as everything took much longer than I originally thought. I would also have liked to manage certain states globally, for example in cases where I need to send props through several components. I had then wanted to use React Context because I had not used it before and wanted to learn it as well.

There are tons of things I wanted to add and try, but I had to draw a line here. However, I will continue fiddling with this little app in the future.
